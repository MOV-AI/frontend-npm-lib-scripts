# @tty-pt/scripts
> Less than react scripts

This project is made to facilitate packing / transpiling projects (especially React projects).<br />
It also provides functionalities to test, lint and watch code.

We defer configuration to the tools that need it,<br />
for example, if you are using webpack, you should provide a "webpack.config.js".<br />
You can easily require the default one and use it in your project.

As stated, this project comes with tools for linting (via eslint) and testing (via jest).<br />
Again, you might provide your own "jest.config.json" (or similar)
